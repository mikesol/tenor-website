1&nbsp;&nbsp;General shape and orientation</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The  TENOR&nbsp;conference is intended to be a small conference, accessible and affordable both to organizers (in terms of organization complexity and financial burden) and to participants. It has the ambition to foster a high level scientific quality and to connect high quality scientific and artistic approaches. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 TENOR&nbsp;focuses on new technologies for music notation and representation, with a clear interdisciplinary orientation. <i>Technology</i> in the conference name refers to any mean that may contribute to the notation, representation and/or visualisation of the music.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Communication with other scientific domains when they share similar or connected concerns are encouraged, in view of the mutual benefit of exchanging different approaches.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

 <a id="tth_sEc3"></a><h2>
3&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conference Review Process</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The review process must be based on full papers.
Papers should be solid, self-contained contributions to a research program.
They will be rigorously peer-reviewed and evaluated on the basis of originality, significance of the contribution to the field, quality of research, quality of writing and contribution to conference program diversity. They must contain clear statements of contribution relative to closely-related work and of the significance of this contribution.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Papers will be published in the main conference proceedings. They will be presented by the author(s) at the conference. At least one of the authors must have paid the conference fee in order to have the paper presented and published.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The organizer undertakes on setting up a reading panel and a selection committee.
The reading panel includes the members of the steering committee and of the conference permanent scientific committee. 
The reviewers (at least three per paper) express their evaluation of:

<ul>
<li> Scholarly and/or scientific quality of the submission
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Relevance of the submission for the TENOR conference
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Organization and structure of the paper
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Readability and language
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Consideration of previous work
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Stimulation potential (scientific/artistic)
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The reviewers provide comments to the selection committee to motivate their scores, as well as indications for improvement to the authors. They will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Papers longer than 8 pages must make a very significant contribution to be accepted.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The organizer must emphasise the reviewers' responsibility to uphold the scientific quality of the process, notably with detailed comments.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The organizer will preserve a minimum of 2 months for the review process i.e. between the deadline for submission and the notification of selected papers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The organizer must inform the reviewers of the final decision concerning the papers they reviewed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Quality is related to quantity. You need a large number of submissions if you are to pick a quality batch of papers. To get lots of submissions, lots of publicity is needed early. This means the biggest publicity push happens very early - at least four months ahead of the papers deadline!

<div class="p"><!----></div>

7&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendations</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<ul>
<li><b><div class="large">Conference management system:</div>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</b>Use of EasyChair (<a href="http://easychair.org"><tt>http://easychair.org</tt></a>) is recommended.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li><b><div class="large">Previous conferences:</div>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</b>All the web sites of the previous  TENOR&nbsp;conferences are available from the  TENOR&nbsp;main site: <a href="http://www.tenor-conference.org/"><tt>http://www.tenor-conference.org/</tt></a>. You can refer to these archives to see how the previous conferences have been organized (topics, scheduling, committee...)

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li><b><div class="large">Scheduling:</div>
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</b>The earlier you announce the conference, the better for its success. Have the conference web site ready for the first call for contributions. Post this call early, between July and October, when the main of the computer music conferences season is over, and don't hesitate to post reminders. 
When preparing the scheduling, typical timing for the various deadlines are available from the previous conferences' websites. However, be aware that the deadlines are rarely met and be ready to grant extensions.
